Simple docker compose for spinning up a portainer behind npm 

you can generate certs for free with letsencrypt through npm. Just first enter the dashboard through http (port http 80 is opened by default) and set up your certs there so you get https connections


you probably also want to change the volumes of docker-compose

note: Sorry if this readme looks so sketchy. I made this repo mostly for myself so I dont forget this conf
